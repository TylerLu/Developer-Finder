## Back-end 

The back-end is a Python (3.6) App. 

* Uses the [Flask microframework](http://flask.pocoo.org/) to implement the web app and routing.

* Uses the [Python Social Auth](https://python-social-auth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library to enable GitHub and LinkedIn accounts to login and returns user profile information from these systems. 

   The following paths are exposed for authentication:

   | Path                                     | Description                              |
   | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
   | /login/*\<github\|linkedin-oauth2\>*     | Navigates users to GitHub/LinkedIn login page |
   | /complete/*\<github\|linkedin-oauth2\>*/ | Endpoint that handles OAuth callback     |
   | /logout                                  | Logout current user                      |
   {: .table .table-sm .table-striped}

* Uses [Azure Database for MySQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/mysql/).

* Uses [peewee](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/) for ORM access to the MySQL Database.

* Exposes the following APIs:

   | Action | Path                    | Description                              |
   | ------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
   | GET    | /api/me                 | Get current user's profile               |
   | POST   | /api/me                 | Update current user's profile            |
   | GET    | /api/connected-accounts | Get current user's connected accounts    |
   | GET    | /api/friends            | Get current user's friend                |
   | POST   | /api/friends            | Add a friend for current user            |
   | GET    | /api/profiles           | Get user profiles                        |
   | GET    | /api/profiles/*\<id\>*  | Get a profile by id                      |
   | GET    | /api/profiles/suggested | Get suggested profiles (friends) for current user |
   | POST   | /api/sms                | Send a SMS                               |
   | GET    | /api/messages           | Get new messages sent to current user    |
   | POST   | /api/messages           | Send a message from current user         |
   | GET    | /api/messages/summary   | Get messages summary (unread count)      |
   {: .table .table-sm .table-striped}

## Front-end

The front-end is an AuglarJS App which provides the following pages:

| Page       | Path              | Description                              |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Login      | /login            | Allows users to login with GitHub or LinkedIn account |
| Connect    | /connect          | Allows current user to connect to the other account |
| My Profile | /profile          | Allows current user to view and edit his/her profile |
| Search     | /search           | Allows current user to search friends, add friend, and start a chat |
| Profile    | /profile/*\<id\>* | Allows current user to view other devs' profile |
| Chat       | /chat/*\<id\>*    | Allows current user to chat with a dev or a friend |

## Nginx 

Nigix has 2 usages in the demo:

1. Serves the back-end app with [uwsgi](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on 5000 port.

   ```Nginx
   http {
       #...
       server {
           listen       5000;
           location / { try_files $uri @backend; }
           location @backend {
               include uwsgi_params;
               uwsgi_pass unix:/app/Backend/uwsgi.sock;
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. Runs as a reverse proxy server.

   The Nginx combines the back-end app and front-end app, and exposes them through the same port - 80.

   ```nginx
   http {
       server {        
           listen       80;
           location / {
               proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4200/;            
               #...
           }
           location ~ ^/(login/.+|complete|logout|api) {    
               proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
               #...
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   Nginx forwards the 2 kinds of requests to the back-end app:

   * Auth related requests: 
     * Login: URL path matches `/login/.+`
     * Login OAuth callback: URL path starts with `/complete`
     * Logout; URL path starts with `logout`
   * REST APIs requests: URL path starts with `/api`

   The other requests are forwarded to the front-end app.

   For example:

   * After you request the `/search` page in a browser, Nginx will forward your request to the front-end app, then return the page generated by the front-app to the browser.
   * After you click the *Search* button, an AJAX request will be created by the front-end app and sent to Nginx. Nginx will forward it to the back-end app, then return the json result generated by the back-end app to the front-app.

   ## Docker

   The Web App uses:

   * Python
   * Node
   * Nginx
   
   We created a base Dockerfile which contains the runtime of the above 3 technologies. The Dockerfile is in `/Docker/python-node-nginx` folder. And it was built and pushed to Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/appsvc/demoapp-base/
