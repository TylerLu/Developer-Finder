## Back-end 

The back-end is a Python (3.6) App. 

* Uses the [Flask microframework](http://flask.pocoo.org/) to implement the web app and routing.

* Uses the [Python Social Auth](https://python-social-auth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library to enable GitHub and LinkedIn accounts to login and returns user profile information from these systems. 

   The following paths are exposed for authentication:

   | Path                                 | Description                              |

   | /complete/<github\|linkedin-oauth2>/ | Endpoint that handles OAuth callback     |
   | /logout                              | Logout current user                      |

* Uses [Azure Database for MySQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/mysql/).

* Uses [peewee](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/) for ORM access to the MySQL Database.

* Exposes the following APIs:

   | Action | Path                    | Description                              |

## Nginx 

The Nginx combines the back-end app and front-end app, and exposes them through the same port - 80.

It also works with [uwsgi](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to serve the back-end Python app.
